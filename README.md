This repository is the download shelf: it carries the release downloads (the current release is 0.9.9, iteration 2) and this gateway page. It contains no source code, and it never will: BAS Hub is proprietary software.

**BAS Hub** is a desktop suite for building-automation controls work. Instead of separate tools (one for programming, one for discovery, one for captures, one for the terminal, a spreadsheet for the records), BAS Hub is one app whose modules share **one device inventory and one backup system**. A device you find in Network+ is the same record everywhere. A write to a live controller goes through the same safety path every time. Your data lives on your laptop, in one folder, and nothing leaves it unless you send it.

## Current release: 0.9.9 — iteration 2

> **BAS Hub 0.9.9, iteration 2 (build iter2, 2026-11-05), is the current build of the current release.** Separate per-OS packages: download the installer for your OS from the [**0.9.9 iteration 2 release**](https://github.com/JacobHamrac/bas-hub-releases/releases/tag/v0.9.9-iter2). Iteration 2 is the Connection Wizard build: Network+ rolls to 2.5.0 — connecting now starts from a Connect button that opens a wizard, Auto finds the network, Deep is the standing scan depth (every object in every device, read), and the scan tracker shows elapsed time plus an estimated remaining time as ranges. The Connections page is retired into the wizard. 53 of the second inspection round's 60 findings are fixed with receipts, including the D-PL2 write-door defect: the Points write doors open only behind a visible selection and a loaded list. Still open, named in the release notes by ID: INS2-33, INS2-48, INS2-53, DELTA-01…04, DELTA-06, DELTA-07, F-23, one dependency advisory under review (GHSA-xrw6-gwf8-vvr9), and the carried product shortfalls. Proven on the shipped build in the test rig (eleven named verification gates green) and installed and verified on a real Windows machine (271 files; Network+ 2.5.0 live in the running app, no-model choice preserved); two re-checks on that machine — the rebuilt Connect chrome and the Mapper's interactions — are still to be driven there and are carried openly. Points against real field firmware remains unproven. A Windows ARM64 package rides in the same release as a candidate build; it has not been verified on ARM64 hardware. The in-app update check reads the latest stable release, so earlier installed builds are offered this one by the app itself; the hop from an installed 0.9.3 or 0.9.4 still goes through the standalone Setup below. Full notes for every build are on the [website's versions page](https://bas-hub-app.github.io/releases.html).

**Download & install**

1. Open the [**0.9.9 iteration 2 release**](https://github.com/JacobHamrac/bas-hub-releases/releases/tag/v0.9.9-iter2) and download the installer for your OS: **`BAS-Hub-Setup-Windows-x64.exe`** (Windows) or **`BAS-Hub-Setup-Linux-x64`** (Linux): each is one self-contained file, with `SBOM.json` and the User Guide (PDF) beside it in the download set.
2. Run the installer. BAS Hub needs **no administrator rights** and installs for your user account only, in a location you choose.
3. Pick the **complete package**, or just the modules you want. Optional extras: **BAS Copilot** (Setup offers the model sizes this computer can run well) and **Npcap** (the packet-capture driver for Network+ live capture, its own signed installer, the one step that asks for administrator approval).
4. Launch **BAS Hub** from the Start menu or your desktop. Your data lives in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BAS Hub\data` and is never removed by updates or by uninstalling.

The full install reference (requirements, silent-deployment switches, and exit codes) is on the [website](https://bas-hub-app.github.io/#download).
